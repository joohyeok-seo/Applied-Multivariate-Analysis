```{r setup, include=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(corrplot)

R <- read.csv("data_for_pr2-1.txt", header=FALSE, col.names=c("A","B","C","D","E"))

a) Compute and display R
```{r}
cor(R)

```

b) Explain the values in R
- These correlation all 1 or -1 which means a very strong positive linear relationship or strong negative relationship.

- These plots' correlation of (A and D), (A and E), (B and C) and (D and E) is 1 which means when a value increases, the other increases proportionally.

- These plots' correlation of (A and B), (A and C), (B and D), (C and D), (B and E) and (C and E) is -1 which means when a value increases, the other decreases proportionally.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)


data <- read.csv("pr2_second_data_set.txt", header=FALSE)

colnames(data) <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")

```

a) Display a matrix scatter plot
```{r}
ggpairs(data,colums=c("A","B","C","D","E"),
        lower=list(continuous = wrap("points", color = "blue")))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(strip.text=element_text(size=12))

```

b)
The correlation between A and B is 0.962. It indicates a strong positive linear relationship which is seem in second row first column plot. Since this value is close to 1, there is a strong dependency.
The correlation between C and D is 0.497. It indicates positive linear relationship which is seem in fourth row third column plot. We can say this plot is dependency.
